# Thymeflow

Thymeflow is a Personal Information Management System, a system that loads your personal data (Contacts, Mails, Events, Location History) from different sources (CardDAV, CalDAV, IMAP, Google, Microsoft, Facebook) into an RDF store. It automatically infers alignments between contact and mail data (persons), calendar and location data (event locations). `thymeflow-back` is the backend implementation in Scala, and `thymeflow-front` is a Web application in Ember.JS.
